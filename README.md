## Overview

* 8 puzzle
* A* search 
* different heuristic functions

## Problem description
The project consisted of a few parts.

1. Creating an online 8puzzle game
2. Implementing the A* algorithm
3. Exploration of A* performance with different heuristic functions

## 1 - Creating an online 8puzzle game
### Dev environment and tools

### Architecture Overview

### Unique programming challenges


## 2 - Implementing the A* algorithm
A* algorithem, uses Best First Search approch to go over a graph, from a starting state getting to a Goal state.
A* uses a huristic function to decide what is the next step.
F(n) = g(n) + h(n)  - (g(n) number of steps done until this point, h(n) a heiristic assumption how many more steps until goal state reached)
We chose two diffrent heruristic functions and explored the diffrence in performance counting number of steps, and time.


### h1 - Number of misplased tiles
    Counting the number of misplaced tiles, was

### h2

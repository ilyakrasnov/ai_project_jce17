## Project Objectives

+++

* Compare performance of heuristic functions for A*
* Apply to a given problem set
* Make exploration visible and accessible

---

## Problem Set

+++

* Randomized 8 Puzzle as starting point
* Implement A* algorithm with different heuristics
	 * Number of misplaced tiles
	 * Sum of manhattan distances
* Visualize solving path

+++

* Test run algorithm on each 100 randomized puzzles with for different dimensions
	 * 3x3
	 * 4x4
	 * *find feasable top dimension*

+++

* Present statistics on performance of chosen heuristics for every dimension
	 * min/max # of steps
 	 * min/max time
	 * avg # of steps
	 * avg time
	 * *ideas for further statistics welcome!*
